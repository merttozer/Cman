# Custom C++ Utilities Project

## Overview
This project showcases the implementation of several custom C++ utilities, including a memory allocator, bitset, complex number class, and a custom string class. It's designed to demonstrate advanced C++ programming techniques and custom data structure implementation.

## Components
- **Custom Allocator**: Efficiently manages memory allocation and deallocation.
- **Bitset**: Implements an efficient array of bits.
- **Complex Numbers**: Provides functionalities for complex number mathematics.
- **Custom String**: Enhances or extends standard string functionalities in C++.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- C++ Compiler (C++11 or later recommended)
- CMake (For building the project)

### Building the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Create build directory.
4. Navigate to the build directory.
5. Run `cmake ..` to generate the build system.
6. Build the project using `make` or your preferred build tool.

## Usage
Run the executable generated after building to see demonstrations of each utility. Further integration and usage examples can be found in `main.cpp`.

## Contributing
